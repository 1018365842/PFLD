TAble 1:  
  The code for cauculating euler angles prediction loss have not been updated ,but is easy for you to edit the code before you train the model    
Table 2:   
  my code has a flaw that i calculate euler angles ground-truth while training process,so the training speed have slowed down because  some work have to be finished on the cpu ,you should calculate the euler angles in the preprocess code
